# MaceVC, a PHP framework, version 0.9.3

MaceVC is a small hobby project to experiment with building a framework on existing components, its a PHP framework inspired heavily by Laravel, and build on several Laravel components and other populair packages, anyone familiar with Laravel will feel right at home in MaceVC.

Some of the features supported by MaceVC:

 * Routing.
 * Middlewares (route specific middlewares and global middlewares).
 * Eloquent ORM.
 * Views with the Blade templating engine.
 * Pretty error messaging in the Laravel 4 style.
 * CLI (Command Line Interface) for easily creating Controllers, Models and Middlewares!
 * Easy mailing with the build-in mail class!
 * Session driver for easy use of sessions.
 * A built-in easy to use Auth class for user Authentication.

There are lots of features that have yet to be implemented, if you have any good ideas, feel free to submit a pull request!
